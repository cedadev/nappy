<center><h2>Preface to Version 1.3</h2></center>
<p>
The file format standards defined in Version 1.3 are the same as those
in previous versions. The main change in this version is the
elimination of the Section on file naming conventions, and the
renumbering of the remaining Sections and pages. The file formats are
independent of any particular file naming scheme, so the description of
the file naming convention has been moved to a separate document.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><h2>Preface to Version 1.2</h2></center>
<p>
            The file format standards defined in Version 1.2 are the same
       as those in the two previous versions.  The major changes in this
       version are to emphasize the requirement that independent
       variables be monotonic, and to slightly change the notation for
       several parameters to show their dependence on the unbounded
       independent variable.  In previous versions those dependencies
       have been implied, and shown by examples, but not clearly stated.
</p>
<p>
            Other minor changes have been made throughout the text to
       help clarify the concepts and requirements of the format
       standards, and variable definitions in some of the examples have
       been condensed.  We appreciate the feedback we have received from
       users of the exchange files, and have used it as a guide for
       clarifying the standards.
</p>

<center><h2>Preface</h2></center>
<p>
            This document specifies format standards to be used to
       facilitate data exchange for aircraft missions managed by the
       Earth Science Division at NASA Ames Research Center.  It is
       intended as a reference document for creating experimental
       datasets.  The standards should be adhered to in all exchange
       files being contributed to the project archive, including
       instrumental measurements, theoretical calculations and
       operational data.  It is important that the person responsible for
       actually generating a given dataset refer to this document when
       determining the format for that dataset.  It is the responsibility
       of the principal investigator or team leader to make sure that the
       appropriate people have access to this document and that their
       data conform to the format standards.
</p>
<p>
            The specifications described in this document grew out of an
       effort beginning with the 1987 Stratosphere Troposphere Exchange
       Project (STEP) to put the experimental aircraft data on a medium
       and in a format that would be accessible to all experiment
       participants during the field experiment.  Flight planning could
       then take into account the data from a previous flight, increasing
       the likelihood of meeting the overall goals and objectives of a
       given campaign.  The standards developed for STEP were also used
       in the 1987 Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE) and the
       1989 Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE).  The basic
       premise in specifying format standards was to create
       self-descriptive datasets using a prescribed header structure to
       contain information about the data in a given file.
</p>
<p>
            The STEP experiment used only the ER-2 aircraft and consisted
       primarily of in situ, time series data.  It was this single
       dimensional data for which the original format specification was
       written.  The use of remote sensing instruments on both the DC-8
       and ER-2, and the generation of model output files creates
       multi-dimensional data which do not fit well into that original
       format.  To better account for the variety of data, we have
       formalized some of the original concepts and have extended the
       requirements for header information to more adequately
       characterize the data.  The file header now must include explicit
       specification of data dimensionality.  We have also allowed for a
       more flexible specification of the data structure by the use of a
       file format index, described in the text.
</p>
<p>
            In writing this new format specification, a conscious effort
       was made to retain much of the progress made in past experiments
       towards creating an environment of free data exchange.  We have
       tried to build a logical extension to the original concepts rather
       than making a radical departure from them.  Those with experience
       in the previous experiments (STEP, AAOE and AASE) should recognize
       that, in many cases, the format for their exchange files will
       remain much the same under these new specifications with only
       relatively minor, but important, changes to the header entries.
</p>
<p>
            We want to acknowledge the fact that this document is the
       product of interactions between the authors and the experiment
       participants; indeed, the idea of data exchange standards was
       originally driven by a consensus of the participants, not by the
       "data managers".  We appreciate the feedback that we have
       received, both written and oral, and have incorporated many of the
       suggestions into the final document.  We also want to encourage
       everyone to feel free to contact us if they have any questions,
       problems or suggestions.

<center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
<p>
            This document describes a conceptual framework for specifying
       exchange data formats, and then gives a detailed description of
       the standard formats (although there are very important
       distinctions between measured quantities and those resulting from
       mathematical model calculations, for simplicity, the two will
       often be loosely termed "data").  Those considering writing
       exchange files must review the format options presented in this
       document and determine the format most suitable for recording
       their data.  If none are deemed suitable, consult with the project
       archive manager to define a new format option.  New file formats
       will be circulated to project participants as addenda to this
       document.
</p>
<p>The primary goal of instituting format standards for data exchange
is to promote accessibility and ease of use of a variety of datasets
from different instruments, platforms and numerical models. The
specific goals of the proposed system are:
</p><ul>
<li> The exchange files must be readable on all computer systems
commonly in use. These include PC's (MS DOS), Apple Macs, DEC VMS and
Unix systems.<br><br>

</li><li> The exchange files must be self describing, such that the
information needed to read the data is contained in an order dependent
file header, and the minimum information required to analyze the
particular dataset is contained within the file.<br><br>

</li><li> Maintain as much compatibility as possible with existing
formats from previous experiments, while allowing flexibility to handle
new datasets and formats.<br><br>

</li><li> Minimize the amount of software required to access diverse
datasets by categorizing the datasets and allowing a minimal number of
data formats.<br><br>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>
            The complexity of any system of standards increases with
       increasing generality.  This standard represents a compromise
       between simplicity and generality.  The generality of the proposed
       system stems from the incorporation of a file format index which,
       by referencing pre-defined format options, defines the format of
       both the file header and the data records.  Thus, new file formats
       can be incorporated at a future time without changing those
       defined in this document.  The complexity of this system increases
       with the number of file formats, so an attempt has been made to
       minimize the number of format options while at the same time
       accommodate the existing standard data formats from previous
       experiments; the file header formats are, however, different from
       the older standards.
</p>
<p>
            An additional advantage of standardized file formats is that
       the data files can more easily be checked for format errors.
       Plans for future field experiments include computer programs to
       check the format of each data file as part of the procedure for
       submittal to the data archive.
</p>
<p>
           The system described here assumes that all exchange files are
       in ASCII, because ASCII coded files are the most universally
       readable across computer systems from different vendors.  It is
       anticipated that the same standards can be extended to include
       binary files as well.  However, before that can be done, a
       convention for external data representation must be agreed upon
       due to the differences in internal representation on different
       machines.  A special naming convention for binary files would also
       have to be adopted.
</p>
<p>
            Section 2 describes the basic structure of the data files,
       the types of variables, and how they regulate the format
       specifications.  Section 3 describes some precautionary measures
       to ensure readable files.  The array and implied loop notation
       used to specify the formats are defined in Section 4, and a
       collection of definitions of the variables and terminology is
       contained in Section 5.  The file format specifications are given
       in Section 6, with a summary of data record formats at the end of
       the Section.  An example of each standard format is given in
       Section 7.  Since any particular format option can accommodate a
       variety of types of data, the concepts, terminology, and format
       specifications are first presented in an abstract manner so not to
       bias or narrow their definition.  The examples in Section 7 are
       included to provide a tangible link between the abstract
       definitions and actual exchange data files.  It will, therefore,
       be useful to refer to these examples while (or before) reading the
       rest of this document.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><h2>2</h2></center>
<center><h2>Concepts and Structures</h2></center>
<p>
            The reason for writing an exchange file is to convey some
       measured, calculated, or otherwise derived quantity, which will be
       called the PRIMARY variable.  There may be more than one PRIMARY
       variable in a given exchange file.  In addition, there may be some
       ancillary information concerning the measurement, calculation, or
       interpretation of the PRIMARY variables or the data records
       containing their values.  These secondary quantities will be
       referred to as AUXILIARY variables.  Usually the inclusion of
       AUXILIARY variables is optional, but there are some format options
       in which they are required because they provide information about
       the ensuing data records.  Both PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variables
       are considered as dependent variables, and are always recorded
       with reference to at least one INDEPENDENT variable.  INDEPENDENT
       variables can be time, spatial coordinates, index values, or any
       other monotonic quantity that can be used to uniquely identify a
       particular PRIMARY variable value.  Each INDEPENDENT variable
       represents a dimension on which the PRIMARY variables are
       dependent.  PRIMARY variables are considered as discrete functions
       of the INDEPENDENT variables, whereas AUXILIARY variables are
       associated with an explicitly recorded INDEPENDENT variable.
</p>
<p>
            The information recorded within exchange files is of two
       types, either numeric or character string.  Character strings may
       contain any printable ASCII character (ASCII decimal values
       between 32 and 126 inclusive), whereas numeric values are
       restricted to characters 0 through 9, the plus sign, the minus
       sign, the period, and the letter E used in exponential notation.
       Except for the purpose noted in Section 3, an exchange file must
       not contain non-printable ASCII characters.  The non-printable
       characters have ASCII decimal values of 0 through 31, and values
       greater than 126.
</p>
<p>
            Each exchange file has a file header which conveys
       information about the PRIMARY, AUXILIARY, and INDEPENDENT
       variables, and the order in which they are recorded in the file.
       Rather than attempt to pre-define a single file header format
       which accounts for all existing data formats, as well as any
       future formats, a File Format Index (FFI) is used to uniquely
       define the exchange file format.  By reference to pre-defined
       format options, the value of the FFI determines the number of
       INDEPENDENT variables, whether the values of the INDEPENDENT and
       dependent variables are numeric or character string, the format of
       the file header, and the format of the data records.
</p>
<p>
            Included in the file header are descriptions and/or units of
       measure for the INDEPENDENT, PRIMARY, and AUXILIARY variables.
       All variables must be defined in the records in which they are
       expected to appear, and cannot be omitted or have blank spaces
       substituted for their values.  Associated with each PRIMARY and
       AUXILIARY variable is a "missing" value to denote missing or
       erroneous data values.  These missing values must be larger than
       any "good" data values recorded within the file so that a simple
       test on the magnitude of a data value will determine if it
       represents missing or usable data.  A scale factor is associated
       with each numeric PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variable.  The scale
       factors are included to encourage recording of the data as scaled
       whole numbers, without a decimal point or exponential notation,
       and thus reduce the size of the file.  There are no scale factors
       or missing values for the INDEPENDENT variables.
</p>
<p>
            The order in which the PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variables are
       defined in the file header is the same order in which they are
       recorded in the data records.  The order in which the INDEPENDENT
       variables are defined in the file header determines the dependence
       of the PRIMARY variables on the INDEPENDENT variables and,
       therefore, the manner in which the PRIMARY variables are recorded.
       The recorded dependence of the PRIMARY variables on the
       INDEPENDENT variables is such that, from the point of view of
       writing the data records, the most rapidly varying dimension is
       listed first in the file header, and the most slowly varying
       dimension is listed last.
</p>
<p>
            If the number of values in the most slowly varying dimension
       is not pre-determined (as with the time dimension in many cases)
       then it is termed the unbounded dimension.  Of necessity, only one
       dimension, or INDEPENDENT variable, can be unbounded, while the
       others, if any, must be bounded.  The number of values in the
       bounded dimensions are defined in either the file header or the
       data records.  Values of the unbounded INDEPENDENT variable are
       explicitly recorded at pre-determined locations within the data
       records and are termed INDEPENDENT VARIABLE MARKS.  The AUXILIARY
       variables, if any, are specified immediately after the INDEPENDENT
       VARIABLE MARKS, either within the same record or the subsequent
       records.  The unbounded INDEPENDENT variable must be a monotonic
       quantity.  The bounded INDEPENDENT variables, for a given
       INDEPENDENT VARIABLE MARK, must also be monotonic.
</p>
<p>
            As an illustration, consider airborne lidar measurements of
       ozone, recorded as a time sequence of vertical profiles of ozone.
       For this example, ozone number density is the PRIMARY variable,
       altitude above Earth's surface is the bounded INDEPENDENT
       variable, and a monotonic measure of time is the unbounded
       INDEPENDENT variable.  The same records which contain time may
       also contain AUXILIARY variables.  Since ozone values at all
       recorded altitudes are read for each time mark, the dependence on
       altitude is considered the more rapidly varying dependence, so
       altitude is the first INDEPENDENT variable defined in the file
       header; time is defined second in the file header.  An examination
       of the standard formats in Section 6 reveals that there are
       several file formats which could accommodate the data in this
       example, the selection of the most appropriate format depends on
       the nature of the altitude measurements.  If the values of
       altitude are constant then FFI 2010 could be used, with the
       monotonic, constant altitudes defined in the file header.  In this
       instance, AUXILIARY variables are optional, but one may wish to
       include additional information, say, aircraft longitude and
       latitude, in the AUXILIARY variable list.  If the altitude values
       are variable, but the interval between the altitudes is constant,
       then FFI 2310 is more appropriate.  In this instance the number of
       altitudes, base altitude value, and altitude increment are
       supplied in the AUXILIARY variable list.  If the altitude values
       and the intervals between altitudes are variable then FFI 2110 is
       the most appropriate option, with the number of altitudes given in
       the AUXILIARY variable list, and the altitude values read from the
       records containing the ozone values.  In these last two instances
       (FFI 2310, 2110), the indicated AUXILIARY variables are required,
       in the sense that they provide necessary information for reading
       subsequent data records, but one still has the option to include
       additional AUXILIARY variables.  Also, the values of the bounded
       INDEPENDENT variable (altitude) in FFI 2110 and 2310 can be
       different for each INDEPENDENT VARIABLE MARK (time mark) and,
       therefore, are dependent on the unbounded INDEPENDENT VARIABLE.
       For each time mark the altitude values must be monotonic.
</p>
<p>
            The file header also contains information on the originators
       of the exchange file and their affiliations, the source of the
       PRIMARY variables, the mission which the data supports, and (by
       popular demand) the number of lines in the file header.  The
       originators will often be the principal investigators for a
       particular instrument or model simulation, and the instrument and
       platform, or model, will be the source.  At the beginning of each
       mission, a mission name will be decided upon and used in all
       exchange files.
</p>
<p>
            Also included, are the date for which the data applies, the
       date the data was reduced or revised (not necessarily the date the
       file was written, although the two may be the same), the volume
       number for the exchange file, and the total number of volumes
       required to record the complete dataset.  For large datasets
       requiring more than one volume of the medium on which they are
       written (diskette, etc.), the data are continued in a new file, on
       a new volume, and after a file header with an incremented volume
       counter (see IVOL, NVOL in Section 5).
</p>
<p>
            There are allowances for three types of comments in the file
       header.  Two of these comment types have reserved locations within
       the file header, and are associated with counters defining the
       number of lines occupied by each type of comment.  The first type
       is for more complete descriptions of the variables, instrument, or
       other comments that apply in general to all of a particular kind
       of dataset; these are called normal comments.  The second type,
       called special comments, are reserved to note special problems or
       circumstances concerning the data within a specific exchange file.
       If the exchange file is a revised dataset then it is recommended
       that the special comments describe how it differs from the
       previous version of the dataset.  The third type of comments are
       merely annotations which may follow numeric values; these comments
       must be contained on the same line as, and separated by at least
       one space from the last numeric value expected in the record.
       They should not be included in lines containing character values
       because the annotations can not easily be separated from the
       character string values.
</p>
<p>
            The data records immediately follow the file header records
       and continue to the end of the file.  One or more spaces (ASCII
       decimal value 32) delimit successive numeric values within a line
       in both the file header and the data records.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><h2>3</h2></center>
<center><h2>Implementation Considerations</h2></center>
<p>
            Even though an ASCII file is the most universally readable
       type of file, there are differences in the way different operating
       systems define the end of a line for ASCII text files.  Therefore,
       some consideration must be given to the way in which files are
       transferred between machines with different operating systems.
</p>
<p>
            MS DOS uses the ASCII characters for carriage return <cr> and
       line feed <lf> to terminate each line, Macintosh uses just <cr>,
       Unix uses just <lf>, whereas VAX/VMS has control words at the
       beginning of each line which give the number of characters in the
       line.  It is, therefore, impracticable to write an ASCII file
       which will appear as a native to every operating system.  If
       inter-system file transfers are performed using some of the
       "standard" file transfer software (Kermit, FTP, DECnet-DOS, etc.)
       then the conversion to the appropriate end-of-line designator is
       done automatically during the file transfer, assuming it is not a
       bit for bit (binary) transfer.  But if the file is written to some
       storage medium (diskette, tape, compact disc, etc.) under one
       operating system, and read from the medium by another operating
       system, then it may be necessary to rewrite or edit the file to a
       form with the appropriate end-of-line designator.  Analogous to
       the end-of-line designator, the end-of-file designator differs
       with different operating systems, but is appropriately converted
       using standard file transfer software.
</lf></cr></lf></cr></p>
<p>
            There is currently no convenient solution to the above stated
       dilemma.  It is mentioned mainly to alert originators and users of
       exchange files to the potential problems with transferring ASCII
       files between different operating systems.  In the past, the MS
       DOS designators have been the convention for transferring files
       via diskette and compact disc, but this may change as technology
       and industry standards change.  In any case, prior to each
       mission, the mode of file transfer, and the acceptable end-of-line
       and end-of-file designators, will be decided upon and communicated
       to the project participants.
</p>
<p>
            Except for the purpose of preparing a file for use on a
       different operating system, there must not be any extraneous
       non-printable ASCII characters within an exchange file.  The
       non-printable characters have ASCII decimal values of 0 through
       31, and values greater than 126.  For similar reasons, exchange
       files must not be Fortran output files with Fortran carriage
       control characters embedded within the file.
</p>
<p>
            Programming languages impose limitations on record length,
       magnitudes of integer and real numbers, and precision of real
       numbers.  To comply with limitations in the most commonly used
       environments, the maximum record length in exchange files is 32766
       characters.  It is suggested that all numeric values be limited to
       seven significant digits within the magnitude range of 1.0E-38 to
       1.0E+38.
</p>
<p>
            For numeric data, there should be an adequate number of
       digits to resolve the anticipated precision, but in the interest
       of minimizing the file size, the number of digits should not be
       larger than necessary.  Also, unnecessary records of missing
       values should not be used to pad the beginning or end of the data
       section of an exchange file.  If, for example, the data from an
       airborne instrument begins 10 minutes after takeoff, and
       terminates 10 minutes before landing, it is unnecessary to include
       10 minutes of missing values before the data begins and after it
       terminates.

<center><h2>Notation</h2></center>
<p>
            The array and implied loop notation, used to generalize the
       exchange file format definitions given in Section 6, will now be
       explained.  The notation is merely a convenient means of
       specifying the file formats, and not intended to indicate useful
       or desirable array structures in computer programs.
</p>
<p>
            Quantities enclosed in square brackets [ ] are read with one
       "read" statement and, therefore, the quantities occupy one record
       which may exceed one line.  One or more quantities appearing in a
       line, and not enclosed in square brackets, are read as one record
       and constitute one line in the exchange file.  Similar comments
       apply to writing the records, but the descriptions which follow in
       this Section are from the perspective of reading the records.
</p>
<p>
            The indices act merely as counters to indicate the dependence
       of some variable, but several indices are consistently used for
       special purposes.  The index m is always used to count independent
       variable marks, and the implied loop over m is unbounded.  The
       index s is the counter for the independent variables (dimensions),
       n for the primary variables, and a for the auxiliary variables.
       The usage of other indices (i,j,k) is less consistent, but usually
       they are counters for the bounded independent variable values.
</p>
<p>
            Consider the array X, which contains values of the
       independent variables on which the primary variables are
       dependent.  To reference a specific array element we write X(2,1).
       To reference a general array element we write X(i,s), where i and
       s can assume any allowable values.  To indicate the allowable
       range of values for i and s we write X(i,s), i=1,NX(s), s=1,NIV;
       which states that s may take on integer values of 1 to NIV, and i
       may assume integer values of 1 to NX(s), the value of NX depending
       on the value of s.  NIV is the number of independent variables,
       and NX(s) is the number of values for the s-th independent
       variable.
</p>
<p>
            Now consider the array V(X,n), which contains values of the
       primary variables as functions of two independent variables.
       Since NIV=2, V(X,n) may also be expressed as V(X(i,1),X(m,2),n),
       or simply as V(i,m,n).  To completely specify the contents of V we
       write V(i,m,n), i=1,NX(1), n=1,NV, where NV is the number of
       primary variables, and NX(1) is the number of bounded independent
       variable values.  It is implied that m can pertain to any
       independent variable mark within the file.
</p>
<p>
            For reading data records, the implied loop notation has a
       slightly different meaning, because then it implies that during
       the read operation the loop index will sequentially take on the
       values dictated by the loop limits.  If the terminal value of a
       loop is smaller than the initial value, the implication is that
       the loop is not executed.  Let the general expression for the data
       format be:<br><br>

       [ X(m,2)  ( A(m,a), a=1,NAUXV ) ]<br>
       [ V(i,m,n), i=1,NX(1) ]  n=1,NV<br>
</p>
<p>
            In the above expressions X(m,2) represents the m-th
       independent variable mark for the unbounded independent variable;
       A(m,a) is the value of the a-th auxiliary variable at the m-th
       independent variable mark; and V(i,m,n) is the value of the n-th
       primary variable at the m-th independent variable mark and i-th
       bounded independent variable value.  NAUXV is the number of
       auxiliary variables.
</p>
<p>
            The square brackets enclosing the first line of the
       expression indicate that an independent variable mark and NAUXV
       auxiliary variables are read as one record which may span more
       than one line.  The second line of the expression is to be
       interpreted to mean that for the m-th independent variable mark
       there are NV records of primary variables, which will be read with
       n starting at a value of 1, incrementing by one for each record,
       and ending with a value of NV for the last record.  The notation
       within the square brackets indicates that, for each record, NX(1)
       values of the n-th primary variable at the m-th independent
       variable mark are read.  In this case, the constant values of the
       bounded independent variable (X(i,1), i=1,NX(1)) are read from the
       file header.
</p>
<p>
            To be more specific, assume there are three auxiliary
       variables (NAUXV=3), two primary variables (NV=2), and four values
       for the bounded independent variable (NX(1)=4).  Given these
       values for the loop limits, the general expressions for the data
       format imply the following record structure (the intra-record
       spacing between values is merely for clarity):<br><br>

       [ X(m,2)    A(m,1)    A(m,2)    A(m,3) ]<br>
       [  V(1,m,1)    V(2,m,1)    V(3,m,1)  V(4,m,1) ]<br>
       [  V(1,m,2)    V(2,m,2)    V(3,m,2)    V(4,m,2) ]<br>
       [ X(m+1,2)  A(m+1,1)  A(m+1,2)  A(m+1,3) ]<br>
       [  V(1,m+1,1)  V(2,m+1,1)  V(3,m+1,1)  V(4,m+1,1) ]<br>
       [  V(1,m+1,2)  V(2,m+1,2)  V(3,m+1,2)  V(4,m+1,2) ]<br>
       [ X(m+2,2)  A(m+2,1)  A(m+2,2)  A(m+2,3) ]<br>
       etc., etc.
</p>
<p>
            If, for the sake of illustration, NAUXV=0 then according to
       the loop limits in the general expressions for the data format
       given above, the terminal value of the loop would be smaller than
       the initial value.  The implication would then be that no
       auxiliary variables were present in the file and, therefore, none
       would be read from the file.  The data records would remain the
       same as those in the above example, with the exception that there
       would be no auxiliary variables in the records containing the
       independent variable marks.

<center><h2>Definitions</h2></center>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt>A(m,a):</dt><dd> value of the a-th auxiliary variable at the m-th
independent variable mark (a=1,NAUXV). If A(m,a) is real, the use of
scaled whole numbers is encouraged.
</dd><dt>AMISS(a):</dt><dd> a quantity indicating missing or erroneous
data for the a-th auxiliary variable. The value of AMISS(a) must be
larger than any "good" value of A(m,a) recorded in the file. The value
of AMISS(a) defined in the file header is the same value that appears
in the data records for missing/bad values of A(m,a).
</dd><dt>ANAME(a):</dt><dd> a character string specifying the name
and/or description of the a-th auxiliary variable, on one line and not
exceeding 132 characters. Include units of measure the data will have
after multiplying by the a-th scale factor, ASCAL(a). The order in
which the auxiliary variable names are listed in the file header is the
same order in which the auxiliary variables are read from the data
records, and the same order in which the auxiliary variable scale
factors and missing values are read from the file header records.
</dd><dt>ASCAL(a):</dt><dd> scale factor (real) by which one
multiplies recorded values of the a-th auxiliary variable to convert
them to the units specified in ANAME(a).
</dd><dt>character string:</dt><dd> a string of at most 132 printable
ASCII characters occupying one line of an exchange file. The printable
ASCII characters have ASCII decimal values between 32 and 126
inclusive.
</dd><dt>DATE:</dt><dd> UT date at which the data within the exchange
file begins. For aircraft data files DATE is the UT date of takeoff.
DATE is in the form YYYY MM DD (year, month, day) with each integer
value separated by at least one space. For example: 1989 1 16 or 1989
01 16 for 16 January 1989.
</dd><dt>DX(s):</dt><dd> interval (real) between values of the s-th
independent variable, X(i,s), i=1,NX(s); in the same units as specified
in XNAME(s). DX(s) is zero for a non-uniform interval. DX(s) is
non-zero for a constant interval. If DX(s) is non-zero then it is
required that NX(s) = (X(NX(s),s)-X(1,s)) / DX(s) + 1. For some file
formats the value of DX also depends on the unbounded independent
variable and is expressed as DX(m,s).
</dd><dt>FFI:</dt><dd> file format index (integer). The FFI uniquely
defines the file header and data formats. It is the second value
recorded on the first line of an exchange file. The first (left-most)
digit in the FFI gives the number of independent variables listed in
the file header, the second digit gives the number of required (in the
sense that they are necessary for reading the subsequent data records)
auxiliary variables. The remaining digits are used to loosely associate
file formats with similar characteristics.
</dd><dt>independent variable mark:</dt><dd> a value of the unbounded
independent variable which is explicitly recorded in the data records.
Independent variable marks must be monotonic.
</dd><dt>integer:</dt><dd> a whole number written without a decimal point.  Leading zeros are insignificant.

</dd><dt>IVOL:</dt><dd> volume number (integer) of the total number of
volumes required to store a complete dataset, assuming only one file
per volume. To be used in conjunction with NVOL to allow data exchange
of large datasets requiring more than one volume of the exchange medium
(diskette, etc.).
</dd><dt>LENA(a):</dt><dd> integer number of characters used to record
auxiliary variable A(m,a) when A(m,a) is represented as a character
string. The value of LENA(a) must be less than 133.
</dd><dt>LENX(s):</dt><dd> integer number of characters used to record
independent variable X(i,s) when X(i,s) is represented as a character
string. The value of LENX(s) must be less than 133.
</dd><dt>line:</dt><dd> refers to a string of printable ASCII
characters within an exchange file, terminated by the appropriate
end-of-line (or new line) designator for the operating system on which
the file resides. The maximum number of printable characters per line
is 132.
</dd><dt>MNAME:</dt><dd> a character string specifying the mission
which the data is supporting, on one line and not exceeding 132
characters. The appropriate value for MNAME will be decided upon prior
to the start of the mission.
</dd><dt>NAUXC:</dt><dd> number of auxiliary variables (integer) whose
values are recorded as character strings. If NAUXC=0 then no auxiliary
variables are recorded as character strings.
</dd><dt>NAUXV:</dt><dd> number of auxiliary variables (integer). If
NAUXV=0 then no auxiliary variables are recorded and no missing values,
scale factors, or names for the auxiliary variables are present in the
file header.
</dd><dt>NCOM(k):</dt><dd> a character string containing the k-th normal comment line (k=1,NNCOML).

</dd><dt>NIV:</dt><dd> number of independent variables (integer) on which the primary variables are dependent.

</dd><dt>NLHEAD:</dt><dd> number of lines (integer) composing the file header.  NLHEAD is the first recorded value on the first line of an exchange file.

</dd><dt>NNCOML:</dt><dd> number of normal comment lines (integer)
within the file header, including blank lines and data column headers,
etc. Normal comments are those which apply to all of a particular kind
of dataset, and can be used to more completely describe the contents of
the file. If NNCOML=0 then there are no normal comment lines.
</dd><dt>NSCOML:</dt><dd> number of special comment lines (integer)
within the file header. Special comments are reserved to note special
problems or circumstances concerning the data within a specific
exchange file so they may easily be found and flagged by those reading
the file. If NSCOML=0 then there are no special comment lines.
</dd><dt>NV:</dt><dd> number of primary variables in the exchange file (integer).

</dd><dt>NVOL:</dt><dd> total number of volumes (integer) required to
store the complete dataset, assuming one file per volume. If NVOL&gt;1
then each volume must contain a file header with an incremented value
for IVOL, and continue the data records with monotonic independent
variable marks.
</dd><dt>NVPM(s):</dt><dd> integer number of independent variable
values between independent variable marks, for the s-th independent
variable. NVPM(s) = (X(m+1,s)-X(m,s)) / DX(s).
</dd><dt>NX(s):</dt><dd> number of values (integer) for the s-th
independent variable. If NX(s) is defined in the file header then it
represents the constant number of values for the s-th independent
variable. Otherwise, NX=NX(m,s) is defined in the data records and its
values can vary with the independent variable marks. In the case of an
unbounded independent variable, NX(NIV) is never specified in the file
but the values of X(m,NIV) are read from the data records (independent
variable marks).
</dd><dt>NXDEF(s):</dt><dd> number of values (integer) of the s-th
independent variable which are explicitly defined in the file header.
If NXDEF(s)=NX(s) then all values of X(i,s), i=1,NX(s) are recorded in
the file header. If NXDEF(s)=1 then only the first value, X(1,s), is
recorded in the file header and the remaining values of X(i,s) are
calculated as X(i,s) = X(1,s) + (i-1) * DX(s) for i=2,NX(s).
</dd><dt>ONAME:</dt><dd> a character string specifying the name(s) of
the originator(s) of the exchange file, last name first. On one line
and not exceeding 132 characters.
</dd><dt>ORG:</dt><dd> character string specifying the organization or
affiliation of the originator of the exchange file. Can include
address, phone number, email address, etc. On one line and not
exceeding 132 characters.
</dd><dt>RDATE:</dt><dd> date of data reduction or revision, in the same form as DATE.

</dd><dt>real:</dt><dd> a real valued number that may include a decimal
point or be written in exponential notation. It is preferred that the
values of real numbers be limited to seven significant digits within
the magnitude range of 1.0E-38 to 1.0E+38.
</dd><dt>record:</dt><dd> a logical record to be read by one "read"
statement. The maximum record length is 32766 characters with a maximum
of 132 characters per line. The first character of a record is also the
first character of a line.
</dd><dt>SCOM(k):</dt><dd> a character string containing the k-th special comment line (k=1,NSCOML).

</dd><dt>SNAME:</dt><dd> a character string specifying the source of
the measurements or model results which compose the primary variables,
on one line and not exceeding 132 characters. Can include instrument
name, measurement platform, etc.
</dd><dt>V(X,n):</dt><dd> value of n-th primary variable (n=1,NV) at
specified values of independent variables X. If V is real then the use
of scaled whole numbers, without decimal points, is encouraged.
</dd><dt>VMISS(n):</dt><dd> a quantity indicating missing or erroneous
data values for the n-th primary variable. VMISS(n) must be larger than
any "good" data value, of the n-th primary variable, recorded in the
file. The value of VMISS(n) defined in the file header is the same
value that appears in the data records for missing/bad values of
V(X,n).
</dd><dt>VNAME(n):</dt><dd> a character string giving the name and/or
description of the n-th primary variable, on one line and not exceeding
132 characters. Include units of measure the data will have after
multiplying by the n-th scale factor, VSCAL(n). The order in which the
primary variable names are listed in the file header is the same order
in which the primary variables are read from the data records, and the
same order in which scale factors and missing values for the primary
variables are read from the file header records.
</dd><dt>VSCAL(n):</dt><dd> scale factor (real) by which one
multiplies recorded values of the n-th primary variable to convert them
to the units specified in VNAME(n).
</dd><dt>X(i,s):</dt><dd> i-th value of the s-th independent variable
(X(i,s), i=1,NX(s), s=1,NIV). For some file formats the values of a
bounded independent variable may also depend on the unbounded
independent variable, and in those cases we will denote the bounded
independent variable as X(i,m,s), with s<niv. values="" of="" (x(i,s),="" and="" (x(i,m,s),="" i="1,NX(s))" must="" be="" monotonic.=""></niv.></dd><dt>XNAME(s):</dt><dd>
a character string giving the name and/or description of the s-th
independent variable, on one line and not exceeding 132 characters.
Include units of measure and order the independent variable names such
that, when reading primary variables from the data records, the most
rapidly varying independent variable is listed first and the most
slowly varying independent variable is listed last.

       format index, are given in this Section.  These are fictitious
       examples and any similarity with existing exchange files is purely
       a manifestation of the author's lack of imagination.  For each
       example is a file header, followed by a sample of the data
       records.  Numeric constants in the file headers have been
       annotated with comments enclosed by { }.  The annotations are
       included here as references and need not appear in exchange files.
       The data records in some of the examples have also been annotated,
       but those are solely for illustration since annotations should not
       appear in the data records of exchange files.
